Create a C# console application.

Store application data in a multidimensional string array named ourAnimals.

The ourAnimals array includes the following "pet characteristics" for each animal:

  Pet ID #.
  Pet species (cat or dog).
  Pet age (years).
  A description of the pet's physical condition/characteristics.
  A description of the pet's personality.
  The pet's nickname.
  Implement a sample dataset that represents dogs and cats currently in your care.

Display menu options to access the main features of the application.

The main features enable the following tasks:

  List the pet information for all animals in the ourAnimals array.
  
  Add new animals to the ourAnimals array. The following conditions apply:

    The pet species (dog or cat) must be entered when a new animal is added to the ourAnimals array.
    A pet ID must be programmatically generated when a new animal is added to the ourAnimals array.
    Some physical characteristics for a pet may be unknown until a veterinarian's examination. For example: age, breed, and neutered/spayed status.
    An animal's nickname and personality may be unknown when a pet first arrives.
    Ensure animal ages and physical descriptions are complete. This may be required after a veterinarian's examination.

  Ensure animal nicknames and personality descriptions are complete (this action can occur after the team gets to know a pet).
  
  Edit an animal’s age (if a pet's birth date is known and the pet has a birthday while in our care).
  
  Edit an animal’s personality description (a pet may behave differently after spending more time in our care).
  
  Display all cats that meet user specified physical characteristics.
  
  Display all dogs that meet user specified physical characteristics.

                                                                        ** GUIDED P4**
